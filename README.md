Gravity/Physics for windows!!!

Author: NiceShotToby
Revision: 1.0
Tested On: Windows 8

Currently has Gravity, Bouncing, Friction and Throwing all adjustable.
I did not implement the disabling maximizing but feel free to do so.
Throwing works by taking the difference from when you press and release the mouse and
setting the velocity to that, not perfect but anything better would likely involve complex
management of the threads.

****Suggested Settings******
Realistic: 3 Gravity, -0.5 Bounce, 5 Bounce Limiter, 0.4 Friction
TV Screensaver: 0 Gravity, -1 Bounce, 0 Bounce Limiter, 0 Friction (Toss away and enjoy)
Helium Windows: -3 Gravity, -0.2 Bounce, 5 Bounce Limiter, 0.6 Friction 
Concrete Windows: 10 Gravity, 0 Bounce, 0 Bounce Limiter, 0.8 Friction
